# 42Technologies Coding Challenge
### A lightweight hierarchical sorting program written in Typescript

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

## Features

- Read unsorted hierarchical file data and sort them using a lightweight tree structure
- Provide a single metric or an array of metrics to sort the results per property


This project is a light weight image image processing API that exposes 
image processing functionalities as endpoints over HTTP as a RESTFUL service
that can be setup as a standalone service or as a third party in any application 

## Tech

The project uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [TypeScript] -  a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript
- [gts] - Google's TypeScript style guide, and the configuration for our formatter, linter, and automatic code fixer. 

## Installation

Install the devDependencies and start the server.
- this project doesn't use any external libraries for sorting or datastructures

```sh
cd 42Challenge
npm i
npm run start
```
## Scripts
```sh
 $ npm run lint      'for linting'
 $ npm run clean     'for fixing prettier / eslint issues'
 $ npm run start     'for starting the program' 
```
